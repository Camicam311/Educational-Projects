Students who enjoy video games may be defined as those that like to play very much and those that somewhat like to play. Those that do not enjoy video games may be defined as those not really into playing and those the don't like to play at all. With this definition for what it is to enjoy playing a video game, in general it does seem that it is highly likely that students do enjoy playing video games. From the data we can see that 77.5% of students do like to play video games wheras 22.5% of students in the survey do not like to play video games. There are 55% more students who enjoy playing video games than those who don't. It is apparent that this survey concludes students do generally enjoy playing video games. It is generally known that video games are also very popular in American culture. Only 1 out of the 90 valid responses has never played a video game, this individual was excluded from the distrubtion of those who enjoy and do not enjoy playing video games as it is assumed this person does not know his/her preference due to inexperience.


For those that do like video games, the genres of action and strategy seem to be the genres that are enjoyed the most with 50% and 61% of the  students choosing these in their responses respectively.
Sports and adventure seem to be moderatley enjoyed with 39% and 28% of students choosing these respectively. Simulation games seem to be the least popular with 17% of students choosing this genre. 66% of the students responded that they find these games relaxing. Students also enjoyed video games for the graphics/realism, mental challenge and as an escape from boredom. About a quarter of the responses were distrubuted amongst each of these reasons. Because of this it seems that they are secondary factors to the relaxation effect. An interesting aspect of the feedback from the survey shows that although most students preferred action games, barely anybody indicated that it is because of its skill requirement of eye/hand coordination. All of this data generally indicates that video games provide relief for these students either by allowing them to take a break from the demands of their daily life or if they are bored, it helps them as a source of entertainment to occupy their time. 

The majority of students largely dislike video games because it either consumes too much of their time (48% of respondents selections) or because they are too expensive (40% of respondents selections).  Many students also found video games pointless (33%) or frustrating (26%). A minority of students indicated that they disliked video games because they are boring (17%), their friends don't play (17%), has too many rules (19%) or because it makes them lonely (6%).
